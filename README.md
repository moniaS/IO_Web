# Driving School Project
Driving School Project is a web application, which I was creating for my studies and it is going to help people to pass driver's license practise exam. 
## Purpose of the project
The purpose of this project was to create website, which provides access to map and enable users to add new routes and waypoints on the map. During adding new waypoints you can upload a photo and add description. What's more users can comment existing waypoints. 

Another purpose of this project was learning how to deal with NoSQL database (Firebase).
